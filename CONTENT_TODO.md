---

## Content Source

All content is in: `/Users/ashleymaillet/Desktop/00-PROJECTS/KIRSCH/New Website Content.docx`

To access in future session:
```bash
textutil -convert txt -stdout "/Users/ashleymaillet/Desktop/00-PROJECTS/KIRSCH/New Website Content.docx"
```

---

## File Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for URLs: `/shoulder-conditions/rotator-cuff-tear`
- Keep consistent with existing pattern in codebase
- Update metadata with proper SEO titles and descriptions

---

## Notes for Next Session

1. **Large instruction pages** (Preparing for Surgery, Post-Op Instructions, What To Expect) have MULTIPLE pages of detailed content - budget significant time
2. **20 individual pages** need to be created from scratch with real medical content from the document
3. The document has **extensive detailed content** - this is not placeholder replacement, it's comprehensive medical information
4. After all pages created, must update Header.tsx navigation dropdowns (both desktop and mobile)
5. Patient Testimonials page currently has Lorem Ipsum placeholders - awaiting real testimonials
6. Patient Education Videos page is placeholder only - awaiting video content

---

## Estimated Scope

- **High complexity:** 3 large instruction pages (extensive medical protocols)
- **Medium complexity:** 20 individual condition/procedure pages (detailed medical content)
- **Low complexity:** 3 overview/FAQ pages (shorter content updates)
- **Navigation update:** Header component (add 20 new dropdown links)

**Total:** 26 page updates + navigation = substantial work session(s)
